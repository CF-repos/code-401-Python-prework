# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Python

## Pre-work

This is the mandatory pre-work for Code 401: Python that counts as 5 full coding assignments (effectively a week's worth of work).
When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it.
Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and not get overwhelmed.

### Set Up

1. Setup your computer with Terminal, Git, GitHub, and Slack

- [Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/osx)

2. Verify that you have Homebrew installed on your computer (if you have a Mac). If you're on Linux, you'll do similar stuff with `apt-get`. Ensure that you have root access.

- [Download and Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- If you are using a Windows machine, figure out a way to safely partition your computer and boot a good Linux distribution like Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04

3. Verify that you have Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 installed on your computer. It'd be nice to have Python 3.5 installed as well, but if you do install it yourself install it before installing Python 3.6.

- To check if you have Python at all, type `which python`. If you have it, your terminal will return something like `/usr/local/bin/python`.
- To check which version(s) of Python you have, type `python --version` and `python3 --version`.
- 3.6 was just released 12/23/2016, so many computers won't have it by default. Check [Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for information on how to get different versions of Python. Note that installing Python 3.6 **WILL** redirect your `python3` shell command (if you have it) to point to Python 3.6.

4. Ensure that you have Python `pip` for both 2.7 and 3+. 

- In a terminal window type `which pip`. If you've got pip, your terminal should output text like this (but not identical to it) `/usr/local/bin/pip`
- [Download and install here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if you don't get anything back.

### Active Assignments

Having a level of comfort with the basic skills youâ€™ll be using every day is vital to your success.

From the pre-work assignments below, please select the area in which you are the weakest.
Begin by working on that.
Once you have spent at least 10 hours on that area, select your next weakest area and move on to that.

You do not need to do a lot of work every day.
One hour is enough, though just.
The key is to work every single day.
Do not let a day go by without spending your time practicing.
